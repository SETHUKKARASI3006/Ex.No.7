# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

## Date: 16-09-2025
## Register no.: 212223230201
## Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## AI Tools Required: 
ChatGPT

## Explanation: 
Prompt:
```
During a busy day, if a couple of scheduled tasks get canceled unexpectedly, how would you prompt the AI to review your remaining agenda and instantly reorganize your schedule to optimize your time, possibly recommending new priorities or opportunities for rest?
```
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

## Actual Output:

```
If you want the AI to **instantly reorganize your schedule** after tasks get canceled, your prompt should clearly:

1. Provide today‚Äôs agenda (with times and priorities).
2. Mention which tasks got canceled.
3. Specify your preferences (optimize productivity vs. include rest).
4. Ask the AI to reorganize and recommend new priorities.

Here‚Äôs an example **optimized prompt** you could use:

### üìù Example Prompt to AI

*"Here is my schedule for today:*

* 9:00‚Äì10:00 ‚Äî Team meeting
* 10:30‚Äì12:00 ‚Äî Client call (canceled)
* 12:00‚Äì1:00 ‚Äî Lunch
* 1:00‚Äì2:00 ‚Äî Report writing
* 2:30‚Äì3:30 ‚Äî Product demo (canceled)
* 4:00‚Äì5:30 ‚Äî Project planning
```

```
*Two tasks (the 10:30 client call and the 2:30 demo) are canceled. Please reorganize my agenda to make the best use of my time. Suggest where I can:*

* Move up tasks or add buffer time
* Insert focus blocks for deep work
* Allocate short breaks for rest and recovery
* Recommend any opportunistic tasks I could slot in\*."

### üîÑ Example AI Response (what you‚Äôd expect)

* **9:00‚Äì10:00** ‚Äî Team meeting (as planned)
* **10:30‚Äì11:30** ‚Äî Move up report writing (use fresh energy)
* **11:30‚Äì12:00** ‚Äî Short review of yesterday‚Äôs notes
* **12:00‚Äì1:00** ‚Äî Lunch
* **1:00‚Äì2:00** ‚Äî Deep work block (optional research / backlog cleanup)
* **2:00‚Äì2:30** ‚Äî Rest / walk break
* **4:00‚Äì5:30** ‚Äî Project planning (as scheduled)
```

‚ú® This way, the AI not only **fills gaps** but also **optimizes your energy** by suggesting breaks and high-focus windows.
